This is a simple score module to flash a number based on time to complete onto the seven seg display.
The top level here is just a debug top level - the 'game over' signal is asserted with the center push button on the
pad. (or button[5], which i think is the center one). 

This is not actually tested because my licence is not being recognized right now - but its simple enough that it should
work with no problems, and the module top level plus the score.v file can just be thrown into the final project in like
2 seconds.
