These files will synthesize into a program which will display the 3 hex digits of the y acceleration, the top digit of the 
x acceleration, and the x,y position of the ball (restricted to a 4 bit large map right now, for testing). 

The lower 8 bits of the x position do not display because I got a weird error when I tried to write them into the seven
seg.
