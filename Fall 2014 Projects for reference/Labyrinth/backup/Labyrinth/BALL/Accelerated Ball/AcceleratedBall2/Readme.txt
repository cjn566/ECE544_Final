this version of the accelerated ball takes a very simple ball which takes as input 4 tilt modes, generated by the 
accelarithmetics.v file, instantiated inside the accelerometerctl.vhd module. Please see comments in the 
accelarithmetics.v file - its action is well documented. Do not confuse accelarithmetics.v with accelarithmetics.vhd, 
which exists for reference only.
